# Xilinx Varium C1100 FPGA development through Vitis

Of course the better course of action here is to join the Xilinx Developeer Program to have access to several training opportunities and content!

You probably won't get the training sessions for the Adaptive computing Challenge, but all the training for Vitis and Vivado is great.

#### In essence we want to do exactly what Amazon is doing on that image, but for Decentralized cloud via Flux.

The amount of documentation to develop and run Vitis and Vivado is staggering but let's go to the basics.

#### If you followed Chapter 0 of the project, you already have a linux PC/Server/Machine with Ubuntu (a linux distro) and with the perfect configuration to start with Vitis and Vivado as you already have OpenCL installed!

And we also have to mention that if you folloed Chapter 1 you also have several examples of Machine learning examples (done on the ZCU104) that can also be adapted for the C1100 as a Cloud service.

These examples are for just YoloV3 Machine Learning algorithms, but that can be accelerated via the Vitis Vision Library.
